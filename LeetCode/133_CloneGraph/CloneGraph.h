     * The tricky aspect is that the neighbors of a given node can be:
     * 1. an end node of itself (no more further neighbors)
     * 2. having one or more neighbors that form a cycle with previously visited nodes - directly, or indirectly
     * another fact to note is that: you don't have to worry if the root node given can "reach" all the other nodes in *any* graph
     * - you don't picture a cluster of nodes, and pick any random node, wishing it can reach all the nodes in the imaginary graph
     * the simple fact is: any node could be itself a root node, the graph starting from this node is all nodes it could reach following
     * the current neighbor relationship -
     * the basic thinking is: keep track of the visited nodes, for each cloned node, put the two matching nodes (source graph, and the cloned graph) into the mapping
     * if any node is visited, don't follow down the path (this is essentially a DFS);
     * for each neighbor of a node, clone is a recursive process, so the same clone function can be reused to traverse the graph in a DFS manner recursively
     * whenever the traversal meets a visited node on the original graph, the mapped node is returned and the DFS traveral for this branch should end;
     * recursion then handles the backtracking automatically
