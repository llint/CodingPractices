    /*
     * there is a similar problem: how to detect if a string has non-repeating characters
     * brutal force approach would be: for each character in the string, check it against all the other characters, complexity is O(n^2)
     * optimal approach: for each character in the string, build an occurrences table incrementally, check each character against the occurrences table
     * mark the occurrence of the new character if not existing, or otherwise, we've found a duplicate - complexity is O(n) - since we are going through
     * the string only once, and we build the table incrementally!
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * - keep track of the start and end indices, both begin at 0
     * - keep track of the character occurrences of the current string [start, end), with the index of the character in the original whole string
     * - move the end index forward, for each new character introduced, if it is not in the occurrences table, add the character with the absolute index in the original string
     * - if it is in the occurrences table, we've found a duplicate in the current (start, end) substring; so we move the start index all the way to the index that is after
     *   the duplicated character index (which could be retrieved from the occurrences table);
     * - while moving the start index to the new location, reset the entries in the occurrences table for those characters that are skipped by the start index (since they may
     *   re-appear later), the new start index marks the start of the new substring to check - up until the current end index (which caused the duplicate)
     * - add the new character to the occurrences table - even if it is the one which caused the duplicate (since it has been removed from the occurrences table by the move of the
     *   start index to the new location.
