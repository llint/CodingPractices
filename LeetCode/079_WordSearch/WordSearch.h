     Algorithm: this is essentially DFS
     1. look for the first character in the input word in the board in a linear fashion
     2. once the first character is located in the board, from this location conduct the recursive DFS process
     3. the recursive DFS process takes the folloing inputs:
        - the board itself
        - the pivot location
        - the word string (immutable)
        - the current index into the world to check
     4. if the character at the pivot location is the same as the current character to check in the input word,
        mark the pivot position as visited
     5. for the 4 directions around the pivot position, conduct the same DFS process on each branch, and if any
        branch returns true, we are done - no need to check other directions (early exit)
     6. when the current level of DFS is finished, restore the original character at the pivot position, so the
        this character is not marked as visited anymore, so the previous level DFS would check another direction
        and this location can be visited again - remember this is a recursive process, back tracking should make
        sure the state is restored when the current level finished? and as a side effect, when the full word is
        verified, and all the DFS stack is rewinded, the board is then restored to its original content, without
        any marks!
        note that originally I was using a hashset to track the visited locations instead of directly marking,
        and pass the hashset by value to each lower level of DFS, to achieve automatic state restore after rewinding
        the overhead of copying the hashset (and destructing) at each DFS level is quite expensive, even though
        with the benefits of automatic back tracking restoring - this is similar to functional programming, but
        just too expensive.
