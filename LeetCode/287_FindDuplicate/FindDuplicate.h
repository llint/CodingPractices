         Algorithm: based on the fact that the numbers range from 1 to n and we have n+1 slot array
         based on the pegion theorithm, there must be at least one duplicate of one number
         the algorithm to find the duplicate without using any extra space (e.g. no hashmap, or tree) is:
         starting from the first item in the input array, swap it with the number in the corresponding index
         if the number at a given index is matching (number == index + 1), move to the next index and repeat the process
         if a number is larger than the valid index, it is a duplicate, we are done.
         Note: the basic algorithm is actually try to place each number to its actual index (in place), and if there are duplicates
         the corresponding location should already have that number

         NB: this algorithm may feel like O(n^2) at first glance, since a rough thinking is every value would be potentially swapped with other values
         and worst case at each index, remaining - 1 swaps would happen, so it feels like n x (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1, and this is roughly O(n^2)
         however, each swapping has a significant effect, in that each swap will put a number back to its corresponding index
         so a seemingly worst cast swapping at index 0 for n - 1 times would already put all the number in place already, and the duplicate already found (XXX)!
         so the runtime complexity is still O(n)

         Algorithm: this is both tricky and simple - (and elegant)
         for each number in the array, mark the value in the corresponding index (n - 1) to be negative
         as we go through the array, if there is another number in the array that tries to mark the corresponding value, and found it is already negative
         it means this number must be a duplicate of a number that has already appeared
         the reason for setting the corresponding value to be minus is that it preserves the original number, and also provides a flag for "marked" already
         one needs to be careful that since any value along going through the array could be already negative, so we need to use std::abs to get the original value
